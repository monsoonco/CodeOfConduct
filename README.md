Coder Code of Conduct

inspired by the Software Engineering Code of Ethics (http://www.acm.org/about/se-code)

1.  We are confident enough to say, "I don't know"

2.  We do not use offensive or explicit language in checked in code, whether in a comment or as a variable or method name.  That includes quoting song lyrics in comment blocks and swearing in log statement.

3.  When reviewing code the  review is focused on improvements to the code, not to the coder being reviewed or the original author of the code.    

4.  We accept full responsibility for our own work.

6.  We are fair and honest in all our documentation.  

7.  We keep accessibility in mind during design and implementation of code.  

8.   We do not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either illegally or unethically.  We create software and should respect software authors.  

9.   We have an obligation to disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents.

10.  We must ensure that any document upon which we rely has been approved, when required, by someone authorized to approve it.

11.  We keep private any confidential information, where such confidentiality is consistent with the public interest and consistent with the law.

13.  We work to follow professional standards, when available, that are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only when ethically or technically justified.

14.  We strive to fully understand the specifications for software we are building.

15.  We ensure that specifications for software on which they work have been well documented, satisfy the usersâ€™ requirements and have the appropriate approvals.

16.  We ensure adequate documentation, including significant problems discovered and solutions adopted, for any project on which we work.

17.  We work to develop software and related documents that respect the privacy of those who will be affected by that software.

18.  We are careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means, and use it only in ways properly authorized.

19.  We maintain the integrity of data, being sensitive to outdated or flawed occurrences.

20.  We treat all forms of software maintenance with the same professionalism as new development.

21.  We never unjustly prevent someone from taking a position for which that person is suitably qualified.
